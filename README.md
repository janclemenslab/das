# Deep Audio Segmenter
_DAS_ is a method for automatically annotating song from raw audio recordings based on a deep neural network. _DAS_ can be used with a graphical user interface, from the terminal, or from within python scripts.

If you have questions, feedback, or find bugs please raise an [issue](https://github.com/janclemenslab/das/issues).

Please cite _DAS_ as:
