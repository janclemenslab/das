    "\n",
    "This may look a bit complicated at first sight but only requires you to change two things in the next two cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The functions for loading the data (song recordings) and the annotations need to be adapted to work with your data.\n",
    "2. Two lists with the names of data files (consumed by `load_data`) and the associated annotation files (consumed by `load_annotation`) need to be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook works with a small toy data set (with song recordings from the data provided with [Stern (2014)](https://www.janelia.org/lab/stern-lab/tools-reagents-data)) and with annotations produced by [Murthylab_FlySongSegmenter](https://github.com/murthylab/MurthyLab_FlySongSegmenter).\n",

    "__Note:__ For this tutorial to work, you first need to download some data and example models (266MB) from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wnj3389k8ei8i1c/AACy7apWxW87IS_fBjI8-7WDa?dl=0) and put the four folders in the `tutorials` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Internals\n",
    "The dataset is created in two steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the data and annotations for different recordings are combined in a large matrix. This works even with large datasets that don't fit in memory thanks to [zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html#storage-alternatives), which provides an interface for on-disk arrays. The annotations are converted from lists of event times to one-hot-encoded probability vectors, (0 for no event, 1 for a specified short duration (default is $\\pm$30 samples) surrounding the event).\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the zarr dataset is converted to a directory hierarchy of numpy files (npy) using `das.npy_dir_save`. Numpy files allow extremely fast memory mapping, providing faster out-of-memory access than zarr during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code below closely follows the code used in the GUI - see the [source](https://github.com/janclemenslab/xarray-behave/blob/master/src/xarray_behave/gui/DAS.py) code."

    "Once all data and annotation files have been appended to the store, save the data as an `npy_dir` store - a directory hierarchy that replicates the nested dictionary structure of the zarr store. For instance, the data set at `root['train']['x']` (the audio data for training) will be stored as `store_name/train/x.npy`. We use these npy files rather than the zarr store because access is faster. Saving is done by `das.npy_dir_save`. The directory structure is mapped back to a nested dictionary via `das.npy_dir.load`. If you used the `DirectoryStore` during assembly, you can delete the `*.zarr` directory after that final step."
